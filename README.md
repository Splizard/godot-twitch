# Twitch Godot

This project is somewhere between early alpha and abandoned. 

## Setup and build

Follow the installation for [grow-graphics/gd](https://github.com/grow-graphics/gd) and you should be able to simply run `gd` to build and start the project. This repo comes with a proof of concept godot project but I think the resulting `graphics/library.gdextension` and corresponding DLL, SO or dylib file should work if copied over to any other godot project.
